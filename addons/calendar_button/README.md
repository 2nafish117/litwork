![](icon.png)

This will add a CalendarButton node that allows you to easily select a date without having to do all the work of creating your own Calendar and Date classes.
Very easy to use.

## How to implement in your project

1. Place CalendarButton in your scene
2. From a script of your choice, get the CalendarButton node
3. Using the node, add a connection: calendar_button_node.connect("date_selected", self, "your_func_here")
4. Create a function "func your_func_here(date_obj)". Note that it expect an argument.
5. Do a test inside "your_func_here", such as:  print(date_obj.date("DD-MM-YYYY"))

### Manual Plugin Installation

> Follow these steps if you are unable to find the CalendarButton Node.

1. Put the addons folder in the root of your Godot Engine project.
2. Go to the "Project" menu dropdown and select "Project Settings".
3. Select the "Plugins" tab. 
4. Select "Update" if you do not see the plugin.
5. Enable it.

**Code Example:**

func _ready():
	var calendar_button_node = get_node("path/to/CalendarButton")
	calendar_button_node.connect("date_selected", self, "your_func_here")

func your_func_here(date_obj):
	print(date_obj.date()) # Use the date_obj wisely :)
